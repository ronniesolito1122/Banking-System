Version 2 - User Dashboard

In this version, we have already implemented depositing, withdrawing, checking balances, viewing transaction history, and transferring money in our banking system (all still under further development). With these basic functionalities of a banking system, we now have created a user dashboard. Note that: the transferring of money only works within our banking system (J.R.E² to J.R.E² bank only as of now).  We're constantly improving security and other functionalities and features of the system.
