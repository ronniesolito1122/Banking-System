Version 1 - Basic Creation and Log-in of Account

In this version, we implemented the basic creation of an account. 
The user is prompted to enter an 8-digit account number and a 6-digit PIN. 
For now, this is the only functionality of version 1. 

Note that: functionalities like depositing, withdrawing, checking balances, and transferring money are still under development. 
This initial version paves the way for a more comprehensive banking experience in upcoming updates.
